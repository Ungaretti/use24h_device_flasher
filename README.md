# use24h_device_flasher

###This program flashes the use24h firmware into a use24h device. Quick and easy.

You may choose to download the .zip file and extract it in a folder or download the standalone executable. 

The contents of the zip file, once extracted, have an executable, a copy of esptool-ck and the firmware binary file. It executes a little faster since the standalone executable is actually a "wrapped" version of of the contents of the zip file and has to be decompressed at each execution.

### Note: the firmware that comes with both releases is NOT the use24 firmware yet, as it is still in development.

Actually this program has an "+Options" window that allows you to flash any firmware into any NodeMcu development board (ESP8266).
