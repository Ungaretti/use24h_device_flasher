# use24h_device_flasher-3.0

### This program flashes the use24h firmware into an ESP8266 device. Quick and easy.

Version 3.0 is a simplification of version 2.0, but I believe it's more straightforward. It has only one main window and allows programming SONOFF BASIC devices.

The contents of the zip file, once extracted, have an executable, a copy of [Esptool-ck](https://github.com/igrr/esptool-ck) and the firmware binary file.

It executes a little faster since the standalone executable is actually a "wrapped" version of of the contents of the zip file.

### Note: the firmware that comes with both releases is NOT the use24 firmware yet, as it is still in development.

Actually this program has an "+Options" window that allows you to flash any firmware into any NodeMcu development board (ESP8266).

[Esptool-ck](https://github.com/igrr/esptool-ck) is a program writen in C to flash firmware to the ESP8266. Don't confuse it with exptool.py, a python program that does pretty much the same thing, but requires python installed in your computer.
